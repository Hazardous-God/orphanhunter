### Real-World Example

**Before:**
```php
$url = "https://dev.example.com/api/users.php";
$link = '<a href="https://dev.example.com/about.php">About</a>';
header("Location: https://dev.example.com/dashboard.php");
```

**After (using BASE_URL format):**
```php
$url = BASE_URL . '/api/users.php';
$link = '<a href="' . BASE_URL . '/about.php">About</a>';
header("Location: " . BASE_URL . '/dashboard.php');
```

**External URLs preserved:**
```php
// These remain unchanged
$cdn = "https://cdn.example.com/library.js";
$google = "https://google.com/search";
$citation = "https://wikipedia.org/article";
```
